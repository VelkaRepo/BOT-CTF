# Images

- Open file and look
- Run `file`
- Run `strings`
- Run `binwalk`, if anything extract it using `binwalk -e`
- Run `exiftool`
- Open in text editor check start/end for markers
- If .gif run `convert`
- Run stegsolve.jar
- Check LSB

# Sound

- Open file and listen
- Run `file`
- Run `strings`
- Run `binwalk`, if anything extract it using `binwalk -e`
- Check metadata
- Check LSB
- Check for multiple channels
- Open in Audacity and check spectogram
- Slow down file
- Analyze waveform to see if it's binary
